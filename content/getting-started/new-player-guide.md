Your legend begins now. Welcome to _The Heroes’ Journey_!

## Forge Your Own Path!

In _The Heroes’ Journey_, you’re not limited to just one class—your character can master three unique classes, unlocking endless possibilities for strategy and playstyle. Whether you want to be a spell-slinging warrior, a stealthy healer, or a hybrid of your choosing, this system gives you the flexibility to adapt and evolve.

At first, it might seem overwhelming, but think of it as an exciting opportunity rather than a challenge. You’re free to experiment, mix abilities, and craft a playstyle that suits you best—without the frustration of rerolling characters. This isn’t just about choosing classes; it’s about forging your own legend.
