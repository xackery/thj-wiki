# Step 1
Step 1 can take a long time as the drops are rare.

You’ll first need to quest for 3 pieces of Darkforge Armor: Darkforge Helm, Darkforge Greaves, and Darkforge Breastplate. Each item requires multiple drops. Once you have the necessary drops, you’ll turn them into an undead knight NPC in Temple of Solusek Ro to receive the Armor. There are 2 an undead knight NPC’s in the same room, so make sure to hand in your items to the correct one (outlined below).

The resulting Darkforge Armor items are tradable so you can potentially buy them from someone else. The drops are pretty rare though, so expect that you’ll have to do it yourself in most cases.
- Darkforge Helm
  - 1x Decayed Helm – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 1x Decayed Visor – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 2x Damaged Militia Helm – Drops from Guards in Freeport, Common Drop
  – Turn into an undead knight in Temple of Solusek Ro (North skeleton)

- Darkforge Greaves
  - 1x Decayed Left Legplate – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 1x Decayed Right Legplate – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 2x Melatite – Drops from “CWG” gnomes in SolA, Uncommon Drop
  – Turn into an undead knight in Temple of Solusek Ro (South skeleton)

- Darkforge Breastplate
  - 1x Decayed Breastplate – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 1x Decayed Chainmail – a Tae Ew crusader and a Tae Ew Spiritualist in Feerrott, Rare Spawn and Drop
  - 2x Enchanted Platinum Bar – Created by Enchanters
  – Turn into an undead knight in Temple of Solusek Ro (North skeleton)

# Step 2
Head to The Overthere and find Kurron Ni. He is in town and has a respawn of approx. 4 hours. Give him Darkforge Helm, Darkforge Greaves, Darkforge Breastplate, and 900pp. He will respawn.  Kill him and loot Letter to Duriek.

You may need to say “what mission” to be able to attack him (unconfirmed). He will likely require a group in era, and is highly resistant to spells.

# Step 3
Find Duriek Bloodpool in Paineel. He is located in a small room overlooking the noob area. Give him Letter to Duriek. You’ll get some faction in return (+3 Truespirit). 

# Step 4
Go to Neriak A (Foreign Quarter). Give 1000pp to Smaka to receive Cough Elixir.

Note: For additional faction, you may be able do Step 4 and Step 5 twice to skip Step 6, but I have not personally tested this.

#Step 5
Go back to Paineel and give the  Cough Elixir to Duriek Bloodpool (+3 Truespirit).

# Step 6
Head to The Hole and kill a ratman guard. Loot Dusty Tome. Always Drops.

There are two PH’s depending on which version of The Hole your server is one.

1.0 Hole (Pre-LDoN): The PH is a ratman warrior. Spawns in the jail area (+365, -90). You may need a group to kill a ratman guard in early eras. There may be additional spawns as well but not confirmed. A tracker can help.

2.0 Hole (LDoN+): The PH is a ratman inhabitant. There are 5 PH rats. They roam in the highlighted circle the city and tower area. A tracker is recommended.

Note: While here you can also do Step 14 (Loot Cell Key from a chest)

Once you have Dusty Tome give it to Duriek Bloodpool back in Paineel for some faction (+3 Truespirit).

# Step 7
Go to Plane of Sky. Kill mobs (any island) until you get a Blade of Abrogation. Rare drop.

# Step 8
Obtain a Ghoulbane. You can get one from either:
- the froglok shin lord in Upper Guk (rare spawn and drop). Roughly level 30.
- Joren Nobleheart in Felwithe B. He is located in through center teleport pad in the back room. Joren Nobleheart is level 60 and is a harder fight of the two (Hits 200+, estimated 30K HP), but he drops the sword every time. I recommend going this route if you have a some friends who can help kill him.

# Step 9
Go to Plane of Fear. Kill either Dread, Fright, Terror, or Cazic-Thule. Loot Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood. Uncommon drop.

Note: It may only drop off Cazic-Thule prior to the Velious revamp of Plane of Fear.

# Step 10
Quest for Decrepit Sheath. 
- Kill Rharzar in Rathe Mountains. Loot Drake Spine. Always Drops. His PH are drakes in the area. Level 55. Casts some 500ish DD’s.
- Kill an ashenbone drake in Plane of Hate. Loot Decrepit Hide. Uncommon Drop. These spawn all over the zone as trash mobs. Bring a tracker.
- Get an Enchanted Platinum Bar. Created by Enchanters.
- Head to the Qeynos Catacombs (Aqueduct System) and find Teydar. The easiest way to get to him is to enter the Catacombs from the Warrior Guildmaster area in  South Qeynos.
- Give Teydar:
  - Drake Spine
  - Decrepit Hide
  - Enchanted Platinum Bar
  - receive Decrepit Sheath.

# Step 11
Go back to Duriek Bloodpool in Paineel. Give him:
- Blade of Abrogation
- Ghoulbane
- Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood
- Decrepit Sheath
- receive Corrupted Ghoulbane.

# Step 12
Go to Toxxulia Forest. First, find Knarthenne Skurl and say “what heart of an innocent” to receive Soulcase (2 slot container).

Next, go to Marl Kastane on Kerra Island (still in Toxxulia Forest) and say “what prophecy” to receive Seal of Kastane.

# Step 13
Go back to Paineel. You’ll need to get to the City area, which means you’ll need a key. You can either farm Kobald faction in The Warrens then get one from a guard, or have a friend/box make an level 1 Erudite to let you in. Pick Lock also works. Once in the city, find Gerot Kastane and give him Seal of Kastane to receive Note to Marl. Once obtained, head back to Marl Kastane in Toxxulia Forest and give him Note to Marl.

# Step 14
Go to The Hole and kill a chest until Cell Key drops. Loot it. Rare Drop.

# Step 15
Once you have Cell Key you’ll need to find Caradon ( +420, -190)  in The Hole. He is located in a jail cell that he shares with an elemental spawn. He has a long respawn timer so if he isn’t up check him every few hours. Give him Cell Key. He will attack. Additionally another NPC, Kyrenna, will also spawn and attack. Kill them both. Loot Blood of Kyrenna and Heart of Kyrenna from the corpse of Kyrenna. Level 55, take a few players to a group to be safe in era.

The Map I have is missing the jail section of The Hole, so here are directions on how to find him:
- Zone in from the “key’d rock” side of Paineel (as opposed to the “dropdown” side)
- Run through until you see a ramp leading down to a pit filled with a massive construct.
- At the bottom of the ramp is a doorway with a lamp on each side of it, run through and take an immediate left into the next hallway, then take the first door on the right (next to the red banner on the wall).
- Run down the two flights of stairs until you get to the next room with 2 doors in it. Take the door straight ahead. The first cubby on the right is the room that Caradon spawns in ( +420, -190). an elemental type mob also spawns in the same cubby.

# Step 16
Go back to Toxxulia Forest again. Give Blood of Kyrenna to Marl Kastane to receive Dark Shroud. Then combine Heart of Kyrenna by itself in the Soulcase (2 slot container) to create  Heart of the Innocent.

# Step 17
Find Ghost of Glohnor at the revenant tower in The Hole. His PH’s are a fallen heretic who spawn in the tombs. Give him Dark Shroud. Mummy of Glohnor will spawn and attack. Kill it and loot  Head of Glohnor and Glohnor Wrappings. Level 56, take a few players to a group to be safe in era.

# Step 18
Go back to Gerot Kastane in Paineel (in town). Give him  Head of Glohnor to receive Head of the Valiant.


# Step 19
Go to Toxxulia Forest and give  Glohnor Wrappings to Marl Kastane to receive Will of Innoruuk.

# Step 20
Final Fight and Epic!

Head to City of Mist. Find Lhranc (0, +90). Give him:
- Corrupted Ghoulbane
- Heart of the Innocent
- Head of the Valiant
- Will of Innoruuk

You will receive   Lhranc’s Token and a human form of Lhranc will spawn. Hail the human form and he attacks. Kill him.
 
This guy doesn’t mess around, so bring a raid in era. He hits Hard. He is still relatively hard even in PoP era so bring a few friends to help. He procs a 500 point lifetap but doesn’t have a ton of HP (32K?). He also runs at low HP. Consider this a raid boss. Once dead, Marl Kastane will spawn just outside Lhranc’s room. 

Give Marl Kastane  Lhranc’s Token to receive Innoruuk’s Curse!
