This page contains information about each class in THJ, namely what they bring to compositions and why you should play them.

## Bard

### Bard overview
Bard fits a similar role compared to it's counterpart in Live and TLPs: it's a support class that makes every other class better. Namely, it adds the following unique things:
* Overhaste: Benefits both melee/range white damage users, and classes that rely on procs.
* Resist songs: Helps you get those juicy resists that will help you beat bosses as the server progresses.
* A strong AOE nuke in Denon's Disruptive Discord, when combined with spell damage and AAs.

Because Spell Damage and procs are so strong on THJ, Bard AOE nukes and overhaste is great here. Also worth noting that instrument modifiers are higher here than other servers. For quality of life, Bard buffs do not need to be twisted or melody'd, they stay on you as long as you don't zone and the songs are memmed.

### Bard synergies
Bard is unique in that it adds something to pretty much any other class, but some key synergies to note are:
* Wizard: With Wizard, Bard nukes get even stronger and it makes your kiting + nuking potential crazy.
* Any tank (pulling, dps, and survivability): Because Bard provides resists and regen songs, it makes tanks..tankier. But, AOE snare also turns you into an awesome AOE puller.
* White damage comps: Bard gets AAs that make you do 20% more white damage to a target, along with Dance of Blades providing Hundred Hands (double attack chance). Which can be really strong when combined with something like Berserker, Monk, or even Ranger (and Cleric for Divine Avatar for another stacking increase)

### Key Bard AAs

## Beastlord

### Beastlord overview
Beastlord traditionally comes with a strong pet, baby Shaman buffs/slows/heals, and some melee damage. On THJ, it also provides the following unique things:
* Bloodlust: This ability makes it so every swing you do, your weapons proc their on-proc abilities. Procs are very strong on THJ, and this gives you an insane cooldown to take advantage of them. While this only lasts 12 seconds, it can be extended with Spell Casting Reinforcement.
* Pet buffs: You can have multiple pets (from multiple classes) in THJ, so your pet buffs gain more value as they affect all of your pets.

### Beastlord synergies
Some strong Beastlord synergies to think of are:
* Warrior: Warrior gets access to some great proc weapons to make use of Bloodlust, is tanky, and brings it's own AA similar to Bloodlust (Rage of Rallos Zek).
* Cleric: Cleric gets Battle Frenzy, which makes every single one of your spells (and procs!) crit for a short time. It also has Divine Avatar, which increases your damage and gives you a short HoT. These things combined with the combined proc chance of Bloodlust make for a very strong composition base.
* Mag + Enc/Nec: As mentioned earlier, Beastlord pet buffs and heals hit every one of your pets, and in turn, other classes abilities do the same. So naturally, pairing Beastlord with other pet classes makes for a strong composition.

## Berserker

### Berserker overview
Berserker is still a two-handed behemoth. It will bring AAs and abilities that help your class do more white damage. Some unique things to note:
* Frenzy: Frenzy is a single-target ability with a short cooldown, similar to Kick and Backstab.. HOWEVER, on THJ, Frenzy hits like a truck. With a weapon with big damage and some AAs into crit damage and frenzy damage, you can easily crit in the 10000s, 20000s, and even 30000s.. at level 50!
* Scaling: As spell damage gets capped, and weapons get stronger and stronger, a white damage class such as Berserker should see a rise in effectiveness as the server ages.
* Potential weaknesses: There are two potential weaknesses with Berserker: you are pretty much limited to 2H weapons, and there aren't many AAs that help with proc or spell damage, which is strong in THJ..at least in the early stages of the server.

### Berserker synergies
Some strong Berserker synergies to think of are:
* Knights: Warrior and Paladin get some solid AAs that benefit 2H weapon users, which is nice for DPS. Also the Killing Spree passive heal (MNK and ROG also get this) helps tanking, as you get a chance to do a burst of healing and DPS after killing mobs.
* White damage folks: Frenzy is such a strong CD in this game, that something like Rogue, Monk, or even Ranger could benefit from having a Berserker in their composition, for a really strong single target hitter on a short cooldown.
* Bard: Overhaste and double attack chance are going to benefit Berserker's white damage greatly.

## Cleric

### Cleric overview
In THJ, Cleric really embodies the "Battle Cleric" persona. It comes with the typical heals and plate armor, but it also comes with some solid DPS additions, namely:
* Divine Avatar: An AA cooldown that increases all damage done, and adds a HoT.
* Battle Frenzy: An AA cooldown that makes all of your spells automatically crit for a short time.
* Summoned hammers: On THJ, the summoned Cleric hammers are quite strong with strong procs, which can be strong for yourself, or given to pets.
* Cures, and invulnerabilities: These things are great for tackling tough boss mechanics.

### Cleric synergies
Some strong Cleric synergies to think of are:
* Beastlord/Warrior: Beastlord and Warrior both get a cooldown that provides automatic proc chance on swing. Combined with guaranteed crit chance (Battle Frenzy) and damage (Divine Avatar) from Cleric, the combination can be devastating in damage, but also great in survivability if one or more of the procs is a lifetap.
* Spell casters: Battle Frenzy and Divine Avatar can make you pump some big numbers on classes that use spells for damage.
* White damage users: Divine Avatar is a great damage increase cooldown to pump up your white damage.

It may look like Cleric is strong with everything, and that's probably because it is.
