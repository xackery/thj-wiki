## Introduction

Normally seen as the self sufficient, soloing powerhouse of EverQuest. Necromancers bring a new and unique twist to your combo in The Heroes Journey.


## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- Competitive high dps for large HP mobs
- High self sustain with strongest life taps in game
- Efficient DoT damage for mana cost with Cascade of Decay
- Great mana regeneration from Death Bloom and Lich Forms
- Amazing healing potential over time with Soul Well item clicks
- Easily obtainable pet focus via necro epic that affects all class pets summoned

### Cons

- Larger cast time on spells compared to hybrid classes
- High technical ceiling to properly "dot twist"
- Low DPS against low HP mobs
- No competitive AE damage spells
- Not the most powerful pet in comparison to other pet classes

## Item Buy List

- Shai`Din Revenant Bauble: Bobbing Corpse: Stacks with Dead man floating for a ton of PR
- Shissar Deathspeaker Staff: Soul Well: Lifetap dot that stacks on unlimited targets


## Low AA and Early Game Mechanic Tricks

When you start with necro in your kit, the first super useful spell you'll obtain is **Lifetap**. This spell, as well as all lifetaps, are positively impacted by Spell Damage.
- Spell Damage increases the damage dealt by your lifetap, which also impacts the recourse healing amount at a 1:1 ratio
- Lifetap can trigger Sympathetic Strike buffs. These buffs are found on various items in the game and are pivotal

Spell Damage can be obtained by collecting items with intelligence on them, once they evolve to legendary they will have spell damage.

If you find yourself struggling to exp and you have necro in your kit, arguably one of the cheapest sources of damage for AA cost is **Cascade of Decay**.
- Costs 6 AA points
- Can be guaranteed landed on a mob by using a duration lifetap spell (Leech, Vampiric Curse are my go to examples).



## High AA and Late Game  Mechanic Trickss

In cases where you have a high HP boss mob that you cannot burn through fast, you can go into "economical dps mode"

- Leech and trigger Cascade of Decay, always keep Cascade of Decay up on the target
- Click {{<item id="2048043" name="Demi Lich Skullcap">}} every 60s to keep the 122 hp regen/tick (and dot) on
- Click {{<item id="2024640" name="Shissar Deathspeaker Staff">}} every 60s to keep the 80 lifetap a tick on
- Click {{<item id="2048044" name="Elder Spiritist's Vambraces">}} every 60s to keep the 71 dot tick on
- Cast {{<spell id="" name="Lifespike">}} to proc Prismatic Strike and heal yourself when all dots are in good status
- Cast your best lifetap when you can't keep up with damage incoming and are concerned for death
- If you are running low on mana, you can do one of two tactics:
    - Use Death Blossom, but be careful, it will take 10000 HP and convert it to 6000 mana over 60s, at 1000 dmg per tick and 600 mana per tick.
        - You can click off the death blossom in your bard songs to stop it early if you're concerned for your health
    - Use mana stone in combat. This requires using Summon Companion to fade aggro or Death Peace
        - the idea is the moment said aggro wipe occurs you will re-aggro nearly instantly, but you can click your mana stone right before re-aggro and get a click off
