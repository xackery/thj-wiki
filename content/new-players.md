## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

{{<button href="https://heroesjourneyeq.com/download/thj-client.zip">}}DOWNLOAD THJ CLIENT HERE{{</button>}}

To start The Heroes Journey (THJ):


  * You will first need an [EQ Emulator account](http://www.eqemulator.org/) 

  * Once that is complete, [create a login server account](http://www.eqemulator.org/account/?CreateLS)

  * If you haven't already, [download the THJpatcher.zip](https://heroesjourneyeq.com/download/thj-client.zip) (you may need to click on the file and tell Windows it is safe by clicking the arrow on the download and selecting "Keep")

  * Right click the zipped download, go to properties, and check Unblock in the lower right. Then click OK.  Then extract the files to wherever you want EQ to be installed. Do not run the patcher in the same folder as another PEQ server install unless you are done playing on that server.

  * After extraction, find and run heroesjourneyeq.exe. This is the file you will run to patch and play. 

  * Click "Patch" if it is Red (THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME)

  * Click "Play" once the patch has finished or if patch is Grey (it will say Complete! Press Play to begin).


##  GETTING STARTED / FIRST STEPS

  * **Remember, you were invited to help test the early alpha version of the server.  Please use the bug report discord channel to report any bugs that you encounter!** 

  * This is a Multiclass server.  After you choose your initial class during character creation, you need to find a GM for the corresponding second and third classes. Use your "Bazaar Portal" AA, and all of the classes have a GM on the Northwest side of the zone.

  * After your three classes have been determined and assigned, go to the"Fading Memory" in the bazaar, and hand in your "Faded Writ". This will result in a weapon and piece of armor for each of your classes, as well as bags, and a Summoner's SynchroSatchel. The Summoner's SynchroSatchel can be put in your bank, and your pet will still utilize it.

  * The Summoner's SynchroSatchel will work like your pet's inventory. Anything you put in there will be utilized by your pet (Armor/Weapons).  In can also be stored in the bank instead of on your character

  * Tearel will be able to port you to fast travel points you have identified. Usually this will only consist of major towns you have been to, during character creation.  At early levels, it's free!

  * The "Bazaar Portal" when used will return you to the bazaar. Make sure to put this on your hotbar right away.  When you zone out of the bazaar, it will return you to wherever you were when you casted it. Some situations exist where this is not the case (Druid/Wizard Ports and Tearel). If you end up in the bazaar with no valid return destination, you will port to your bind point instead. 

  * Once you selected your classes, get out there and kill some monsters!


## FAQ

> [!question]
> Can I reroll my classes if I dont like them?

Not right now. Eventually rerolling for EoM might be a thing, but currently it is not.


> [!question]
> Some of my skills arent trainable, but still show up in the GM list with no level restriction?

One of two things is happening. You are at the wrong GM (It needs to be the GM for the class that owns the skill) or its dual wield, and that is being worked on. Dual wield will not work until the intended level, even if you can equip more than one weapon.


> [!question]
> I have X problem, and I need Cata/Aporia to look at it?

Do not ping them unless its game breaking, submit a bug-report in the discord.


> [!question]
> Why cant I find items that dropped on Retribution or Pyrelight dropping at the same %?

The loot tables are based off of Project EQ right now, not specific to either of the other servers.


> [!question]
> How long will this test last? Will there be a wipe?

This test will continue for an unknown period of time, with an increasing number of invites going out, culminating in open testing. When it is ready, there will be a full character wipe prior to going public.


> [!question]
> Will there be anymore wipes during the Alpha/Beta developement?

Yes, there will be a wipe before open beta, and another wipe before "Official Launch".
